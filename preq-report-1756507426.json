      "description": "AutoGPT repeatedly retries failed commands in a short loop, causing wasted API calls,\nincreased costs, and potential lock-ups. The agent fails to recognize retry exhaustion\nand keeps issuing the same action without a backoff or alternative strategy.\n",
      "impact": "- Rapid increase in API usage and cost without useful results\n- Risk of exceeding API rate limits or being banned by providers\n- Task execution delays leading to degraded system performance\n- Potential chain reaction where retries pile up and block progress\n- Early signs of infinite loop behavior that can escalate to memory issues\n",
      "impact_score": 7,
      "cause": "When AutoGPT encounters transient failures (e.g., network timeouts or API errors),\nit retries commands without effective tracking or exponential backoff. Without\nrecognizing repeated failures, it enters a retry loop where the same command\nis executed multiple times with no progress.\n",
      "mitigation": "Immediate: Kill the AutoGPT task when retry loops are detected.\nShort-term: Enforce maximum retry limits with exponential backoff.\nLong-term: Implement loop detection, smarter failure handling, and fallback strategies.\nConfigure monitoring to detect repeated failed commands and trigger alerts.\n",
