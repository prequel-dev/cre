    title: "Redis Maximum Client Connections Limit Exceeded"
    category: "in-memory-database-problem"
    author: Prequel Community
    description: |
      Detects when Redis reaches its maximum client connection limit, preventing new clients from connecting. This critical issue causes connection failures and service unavailability for new requests.
    cause: |
      - Connection pool leak in application
      - Clients not properly closing connections
      - Sudden traffic spike exceeding capacity
      - maxclients setting too low for workload
      - Slow clients holding connections
      - Network issues preventing connection cleanup
      - Application bugs creating excessive connections
    impact: |
      - New connection attempts fail immediately
      - Application features become unavailable
      - Service outages for new users
      - Existing connections may timeout
      - Cascading failures in microservices
      - Complete Redis unavailability for new clients

    mitigation: |
      IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
      - Check current connections: `redis-cli CLIENT LIST | wc -l`
      - Review max clients limit: `redis-cli CONFIG GET maxclients`
      - Identify connection sources: `redis-cli CLIENT LIST | awk '{print $2}' | cut -d= -f2 | sort | uniq -c`
      - Monitor connection metrics: `redis-cli INFO clients`
      
      RECOVERY:
      - Increase max clients limit:
        `redis-cli CONFIG SET maxclients 50000`
      - Kill idle connections:
        ```
        redis-cli CLIENT LIST | grep idle | awk '{print $2}' | cut -d= -f2 | xargs -I{} redis-cli CLIENT KILL ID {}
        ```
      - Kill old connections (>300 seconds):
        `redis-cli CLIENT KILL TYPE normal SKIPME yes`
      - Restart specific client applications
      
      CONNECTION ANALYSIS:
      - Find connections per IP:
        `redis-cli CLIENT LIST | grep addr= | sed 's/.*addr=//' | cut -d: -f1 | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn`
      - Identify slow clients:
        `redis-cli CLIENT LIST | grep -E "idle=[0-9]{4,}"`
      
      PREVENTION:
      - Implement connection pooling with limits
      - Set appropriate connection timeouts
      - Monitor connection metrics continuously
      - Use connection pool validation
      - Regular connection pool recycling
      - Implement circuit breakers
      - Load testing to determine optimal maxclients
