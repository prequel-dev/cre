    title: N8N Workflow Silent Data Loss During Execution
    category: workflow-automation-problem
    author: Claude Code Assistant
    description: |
      N8N workflow automation platform experiences critical silent data loss where items 
      disappear between workflow nodes without generating error messages. This high-severity 
      issue affects long-running workflows (60-115+ minutes) and can cause workflows to 
      randomly cancel mid-execution, leading to incomplete processing and data integrity 
      problems. Items silently vanish between nodes, with different item counts across 
      the workflow pipeline, making the issue particularly dangerous for production systems 
      that rely on complete data processing.
    cause: |
      * Workflow execution engine fails to properly track items between nodes in long-running workflows
      * Memory management issues during extended workflow processing causing item references to be lost
      * Race conditions in the worker queue system when handling multiple concurrent items
      * Node-to-node data transfer mechanisms failing silently under certain load conditions
      * Queue worker timeout or resource contention causing partial item processing without error reporting
      * Database transaction issues where some items fail to persist between workflow stages

    mitigation: |
      - **Implement workflow item counting checks** - Add validation nodes between critical 
        processing steps to verify item counts match expected values
      - **Enable comprehensive execution logging** - Set N8N_LOG_LEVEL to debug and 
        EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_ON_SUCCESS to 'all' to capture detailed execution data
      - **Add workflow timeout monitoring** - Monitor executions that cancel around 21-23 
        minute mark and implement retry mechanisms for failed workflows
      - **Implement data integrity validation** - Add checksum or validation steps at 
        workflow start/end to detect silent data loss
      - **Use error handling workflows** - Configure error workflows to capture and log 
        execution failures, even when main workflow fails silently
      - **Monitor execution metrics** - Set up alerting on workflow completion rates and 
        item processing inconsistencies
      - **Consider workflow segmentation** - Break long workflows into smaller, more 
        manageable chunks to reduce exposure to the data loss issue

    impact: |
      Silent data loss in workflow automation can cause critical business processes to fail 
      without detection, leading to incomplete data processing, missing business transactions, 
      failed integrations, and potential compliance violations. The silent nature makes it 
      extremely difficult to detect and troubleshoot, potentially causing weeks or months 
      of data integrity issues before discovery.
