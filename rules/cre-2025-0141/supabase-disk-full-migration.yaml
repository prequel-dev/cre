      title: "Supabase Self-Hosted: Disk Full During Database Migration Operations"
      category: "storage-problem"
      author: Prequel
      description: |
        Detects when Supabase PostgreSQL database operations fail due to insufficient disk space during migrations,
        data imports, or large transactions. This can corrupt the database, leave migrations in inconsistent state,
        and cause complete service failure requiring manual intervention.
      cause: |
        - Insufficient disk space for database operations
        - Large migration files that exceed available storage
        - WAL (Write-Ahead Log) files consuming all available space
        - Temporary tables or indexes requiring more space than available
        - Docker volume size limits reached
        - Database backup/restore operations running out of space

        - public
      mitigation: |
        IMMEDIATE:
          - Stop database operations: `docker-compose stop db`
          - Check disk usage: `df -h` and `docker system df`
          - Free up disk space by removing unnecessary files
          - Increase volume size or move to larger storage
        RECOVERY:
          - Restart database service after freeing space
          - Check database integrity: `docker-compose exec db pg_check`
          - Manually complete failed migrations if needed
          - Restore from backup if database is corrupted
        PREVENTION:
          - Monitor disk usage continuously
          - Set up disk space alerts (< 10% free)
          - Use larger Docker volumes for production
          - Implement automated cleanup of old WAL files
          - Test migrations on staging with similar data volumes
          - Configure PostgreSQL to limit WAL retention

      impact: |
        - Database corruption and data loss risk
        - Incomplete migrations leaving schema in inconsistent state  
        - Complete service outage until disk space resolved
        - Potential need for database restore from backup
        - Development/production environment downtime
