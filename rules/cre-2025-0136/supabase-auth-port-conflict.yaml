      title: "Supabase Self-Hosted: Auth Service Fails Due to Port Binding Conflict"
      category: "authentication"
      author: Prequel
      description: |
        Detects when Supabase Auth service (GoTrue) fails to start because the configured port is already in use
        by another service. This prevents user authentication, registration, and all auth-related operations
        from functioning in the self-hosted Supabase deployment.
      cause: |
        - Another service is already using port 9999 (default auth port)
        - System service bound to the auth port
        - Previous auth container not properly cleaned up
        - Docker port mapping conflicts
        - Permission denied when trying to bind to privileged ports (< 1024)

        - startup-failure
        - self-hosted
        - gotrue
        - public
      mitigation: |
        IMMEDIATE:
          - Stop conflicting service on port 9999: `sudo lsof -ti:9999 | xargs kill`
          - Change auth port in .env: `AUTH_PORT=9998`
          - Restart auth service: `docker-compose restart auth`
        VERIFICATION:
          - Check port availability: `netstat -tlnp | grep :9999`
          - Test auth endpoint: `curl http://localhost:9999/health`
          - Verify no port binding errors in logs
        PREVENTION:
          - Use non-standard ports for self-hosted deployments
          - Implement port availability checks in deployment scripts  
          - Document port requirements and conflicts
          - Use Docker host networking mode if needed

      applications:

          containerName: supabase-auth
          version: "v2.*"
      impact: |
        - Authentication service completely unavailable
        - Users cannot sign in, register, or manage accounts
        - Password reset and email verification fail
        - All auth-dependent application features broken
        - API returns authentication errors
