      title: Temporal Worker → Server Downtime → Connection Refused Failure
      category: workflow-orchestration-connectivity
      author: Prequel
      description: |
        Detects failure when a Temporal worker is unable to reach the Temporal server.
        - This typically occurs during startup or after server downtime.
        - Worker log contains gRPC error: "connection refused".
      
      cause: |
        ROOT CAUSES:
        - Temporal server was stopped or not reachable on port 7233.
        - Worker container started before the server was healthy.
        - Network misconfiguration or resource contention during startup.
      
      impact: |
        BUSINESS IMPACT:
        - Temporal workflows do not start or progress.
        - Tasks queue up without being picked up by a worker.
        - Can go unnoticed without active monitoring.

      mitigation: |
        IMMEDIATE:
        - Confirm server is running: `docker ps`, `docker logs temporal`
        - Ensure worker starts only after server is available.
        - Restart worker manually or with retry logic.
        RECOVERY ACTIONS:
        - Add health checks for the server container.
        - Use startup dependencies in Docker Compose.
        - Improve alerting for “connection refused” messages.
        PREVENTION STRATEGIES:
        - Monitor port 7233 availability.
        - Delay worker startup until Temporal is healthy.
        - Add retry logic in the worker code.
