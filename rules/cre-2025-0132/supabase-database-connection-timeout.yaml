      title: "Supabase Self-Hosted: Database Connection Timeout and Service Failure"
      category: "database-problem"
      author: Prequel
      description: |
        Detects when Supabase services lose connection to the PostgreSQL database due to timeouts, network issues,
        or database unavailability. This affects Auth, REST API, Storage, and all database-dependent operations.
        Occurs during database restarts, network partitions, or when database becomes unresponsive.
      cause: |
        - PostgreSQL database container stopped or crashed
        - Network connectivity issues between services and database
        - Database server overloaded and not responding to connections
        - Database connection pool exhaustion
        - Firewall rules blocking database access
        - DNS resolution failures for database hostname

        - self-hosted
        - connectivity
        - public
      mitigation: |
        IMMEDIATE:
          - Check database container status: `docker-compose ps db`
          - Restart database service: `docker-compose restart db`
          - Verify database connectivity: `docker-compose exec db pg_isready -U postgres`
        INVESTIGATION:
          - Check database logs: `docker-compose logs db`
          - Monitor connection pool: Check for connection limit errors
          - Verify network connectivity between containers
        PREVENTION:
          - Implement database health checks with proper timeouts
          - Configure connection pooling limits appropriately
          - Set up database monitoring and alerting
          - Use connection retry logic with exponential backoff

      impact: |
        - API requests fail with database connection errors
        - User authentication becomes unavailable
        - File storage operations fail
        - Real-time subscriptions disconnect
        - Application becomes unusable until database connectivity is restored
