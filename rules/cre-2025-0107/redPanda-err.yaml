      title: "Redpanda Node Missing State Files on Startup"
      category: "redpanda-problems"
      author: Prequel
      description: |
        Detects when a Redpanda node starts up but cannot find key state files, such as the key-value store snapshot or configuration cache. This is normal behavior for a brand-new node starting for the first time but can indicate a problem (like a cleared or misconfigured volume) if it occurs on an existing node that is expected to have state.
      cause: |
        - **Normal First Boot:** A new Redpanda node is being added to the cluster or a single-node instance is starting for the very first time.
        - **Cleared Data Volume:** The data directory for an existing node was wiped (manually or due to ephemeral storage) before a restart.
        - **Misconfigured Volume Mount:** The Docker volume or host directory is not correctly mounted to `/var/lib/redpanda/data`, causing the node to start with an empty directory.
      impact: |
        - **Low (on first boot):** This is expected behavior and has no negative impact. The node will create the necessary files and join the cluster.
        - **High (on unexpected restart):** If an existing node loses its data, it must rebuild all of its state from the remaining replicas in the cluster. This is a very resource-intensive process that puts significant network and disk I/O strain on the other nodes and can take a long time to complete. During this time, the cluster's fault tolerance is reduced.

      mitigation: |
        - **On first boot:** No action is required. This is expected.
        - **On an unexpected restart of an existing node:**
          1.  Immediately investigate why the data volume was cleared. Check for manual errors, incorrect automation scripts, or issues with the underlying storage infrastructure.
          2.  Monitor the cluster health and resource utilization (`CPU`, `network`, `disk I/O`) on the other nodes, as they will be under high load to replicate data to the new empty node.
          3.  Consider throttling the recovery process (`raft_learner_recovery_rate` setting) if the replication load is impacting production traffic.

        PREVENTIVE MEASURES:
          - Use persistent, reliable storage for Redpanda's data directory.
          - Implement strict access controls and change management procedures for the Redpanda data volumes to prevent accidental deletion.
          - Use `rpk` to decommission a node properly before removing its data volumes.
