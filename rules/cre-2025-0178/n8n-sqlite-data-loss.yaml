      title: n8n SQLite data loss due to incorrect pool size configuration
      category: database-problems
      author: mavrick
      description: |
        This rule detects when n8n is running with SQLite database and a pool size of 0, which can cause critical data loss including complete disappearance of workflows and execution history. The issue occurs because the default SQLite driver configuration (DB_SQLITE_POOL_SIZE=0) uses an unreliable single connection mode that can lead to database corruption or data not being properly persisted during concurrent operations.
      cause: |
        The root cause is the default SQLite configuration in n8n when DB_SQLITE_POOL_SIZE is set to 0:
        - **Single connection mode**: When pool size is 0, SQLite operates with a single connection which can fail to properly persist data
        - **Concurrent operation conflicts**: Multiple workflow executions or save operations can conflict without proper connection pooling
        - **WAL mode issues**: SQLite Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) mode may not function correctly with a single connection
        - **Upgrade/migration triggers**: Data loss often manifests during n8n version upgrades (e.g., 1.100 to 1.101)
        - **Silent failures**: Data disappears without error messages or warnings, making detection difficult
      impact: |
        - **CRITICAL**: Complete loss of workflows, including all configuration and logic
        - **Total execution history loss**: All past execution logs and debugging information disappear
        - **Business continuity failure**: Production workflows vanish, causing immediate service disruption
        - **Unrecoverable data loss**: No backup or recovery mechanism available for lost workflows
        - **Silent failure**: Data loss occurs without error messages, potentially going unnoticed for hours or days

      mitigation: |
        **Immediate response:**
        - **Stop n8n immediately**: Prevent further data loss by stopping the n8n service
        - **Check environment variables**: Verify DB_SQLITE_POOL_SIZE setting with `echo $DB_SQLITE_POOL_SIZE`
        - **Backup database**: Create immediate backup of the SQLite database file (typically ~/.n8n/database.sqlite)
        - **Check for WAL files**: Look for .sqlite-wal and .sqlite-shm files that may contain uncommitted data

        **Resolution steps:**
        1. **Set proper pool size**: Configure `DB_SQLITE_POOL_SIZE=2` or higher in environment variables
        2. **Update n8n configuration**: Add to .env file or systemd service:
           ```
           DB_SQLITE_POOL_SIZE=2
           ```
        3. **Restart n8n service**: Apply the configuration change
        4. **Verify configuration**: Check logs for proper SQLite pool initialization
        5. **Test workflow persistence**: Create a test workflow and verify it persists after restart

        **Prevention measures:**
        - **Always configure pool size**: Never run production n8n with default SQLite settings
        - **Consider PostgreSQL**: For production environments, migrate to PostgreSQL for better reliability
        - **Regular backups**: Implement automated SQLite database backups every hour
        - **Monitor database writes**: Set up monitoring for successful database write operations
        - **Version upgrade testing**: Always test n8n upgrades in staging environment first
        - **Export workflows regularly**: Use n8n CLI to export workflows as JSON backups
