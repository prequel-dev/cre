      title: "Self-hosted PostgreSQL HA: WAL Streaming & HA Controller Crisis (Replication Slot Loss, Disk Full, Etcd Quorum Failure)"
      category: "postgres-ha"
      author: Prequel
      description: |
        Detects high-severity failures in self-hosted PostgreSQL high-availability clusters managed by Patroni, Zalando, or similar HA controllers.
        This rule targets catastrophic conditions that break replication or cluster consensus:
          - WAL streaming failures due to missing replication slots (usually after disk full or crash events)
          - Persistent errors resolving HA controller endpoints (etcd/consul) and loss of HA controller quorum
          - Disk saturation leading to WAL write errors and replication breakage
      cause: |
        - Replication slot(s) "patroniN" missing or cannot be created due to disk full or corruption
        - PostgreSQL unable to stream WAL (Write-Ahead Log) to replicas, causing FATAL errors
        - HA controller (etcd/consul) DNS/name resolution failures or full cluster outage (quorum lost)
        - Disk full on primary prevents WAL writes or checkpointing

        - data-loss
        - timeout
      mitigation: |
        PREVENTION:
          - Monitor disk usage on all PostgreSQL nodes, especially WAL and archive directories
          - Set up alerting for replication lag and missing replication slots
          - Ensure HA controllers (etcd/consul) are running on redundant, reliable nodes
        RESPONSE:
          - Restore or recreate missing replication slots
          - Free up disk space and restart affected PostgreSQL instances
          - Restore etcd/consul cluster quorum; check container/network status
          - Perform manual failover if automatic recovery fails

      applications:
        - name: postgresql
      impact: |
        - Replication breakage; secondary/standby nodes cannot receive WAL
        - Potential for split-brain, data loss, or full cluster outage
        - Cluster may lose HA/failover capability; clients disconnected
