      title: "Supabase Self-Hosted: Postgres Container Fails to Start Due to Port Conflict"
      category: "database-problem"
      author: Prequel
      description: |
        Detects when Supabase self-hosted Postgres container fails to start because another service is already using port 5432.
        This is a common issue during initial setup or when multiple Postgres instances are running on the same host.
        The failure prevents the entire Supabase stack from starting properly.
      cause: |
        - Another Postgres instance is already running on port 5432
        - Docker port mapping conflict with existing services
        - System service (like postgres system package) is using the default Postgres port
        - Previous Supabase containers were not properly cleaned up

        - self-hosted
        - container-crash
        - public
      mitigation: |
        IMMEDIATE:
          - Stop conflicting Postgres instance: `sudo systemctl stop postgresql` or `docker stop <postgres-container>`
          - Change Supabase Postgres port in .env: `POSTGRES_PORT=5433`
          - Use Docker port mapping: `-p 5433:5432` instead of `-p 5432:5432`
        PREVENTION:
          - Check for running services before starting Supabase: `sudo netstat -tlnp | grep :5432`
          - Use non-standard ports for self-hosted deployments
          - Implement proper cleanup procedures in deployment scripts

      impact: |
        - Complete Supabase stack startup failure
        - Database service unavailable
        - All dependent services (Auth, REST API, Realtime) cannot start
        - Development environment blocked
