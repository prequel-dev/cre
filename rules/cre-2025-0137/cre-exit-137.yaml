      title: Pod terminated with Exit Code 137 due to OOMKilled (memory limit exceeded)
      category: memory-problem
      author: CRE Community
      description: |
        The container exceeded its memory limit and was killed by the kernel OOM killer.
        Kubernetes reports a terminated state with Reason=OOMKilled and exitCode=137.
        This often manifests as CrashLoopBackOff under sustained memory pressure.
      cause: |
        - Memory limit too low relative to peak usage.
        - Sudden traffic spikes causing allocation bursts.
        - Memory leaks or fragmentation in long-running processes.
        - Under-provisioned nodes or overly strict pod limits.
      impact: |
        - Request errors and latency spikes during restarts.
        - CrashLoopBackOff and reduced availability.
        - Potential loss of in-flight work not checkpointed to durable storage.

      mitigation: |
        - Raise memory requests/limits; add headroom for peak allocations.
        - Enable profiling and leak detection; tune GC/heap where applicable.
        - Consider Vertical Pod Autoscaler for right-sizing.
        - Watch node memory pressure and eviction thresholds.
