      title: "Kubelet EventedPLEG Panic Causes NodeFailure"
      category: "kubernetes-problem"
      author: Prequel Community
      description: |
        Detects a critical kubelet panic in the EventedPLEG subsystem under rapid pod launch pressure. When triggered, the node's kubelet crashes, the node becomes NotReady and all resident pods are evicted resulting in a full node-level outage until manual intervention.
      cause: |
        - High pod creation rate on a constrained node
        - EventedPLEG feature gate enabled (default in v1.33+)
        - Concurrent CRI events exceeding kubelet's goroutine handling
      impact: |
        - Kubelet crash and NodeNotReady state
        - All pods on the node evicted or orphaned
        - Auto-recovery failure unless kubelet restarts cleanly
      tags:

        - kubelet
        - panic
      mitigation: |
        IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
        - Restart kubelet on the affected node
        - Distribute load across nodes
        RECOVERY:
        - Disable `EventedPLEG` via feature gate if persistent
        - Monitor kubelet logs for panics related to evented.go
        PREVENTION:
        - Test EventedPLEG in staging before enabling in production
        - Use pod admission control to slow pod floods on small nodes
