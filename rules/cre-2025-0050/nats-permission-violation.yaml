    title: NATS Payload Size Too Big
    category: message-queue-problem
    author: Prequel
    description: |
      The NATS server is configured to publish messages with payloads that may
      exceed the recommended maximum of 8 MB (the server’s default hard limit
      is 1 MB but it can be raised to 64 MB).  Large messages put disproportionate pressure on 
      broker memory, network buffers, and client back-pressure mechanisms.
      This warning signals NATS is at risk of degraded throughput, slow
      consumers, and forced connection closures intended to protect cluster
      stability.
    cause: |
      - The `max_payload` setting was increased (or left unbounded) in the
        server configuration, allowing oversized publishes.
      - Clients are batching or embedding large binary blobs (e.g., files,
        images, or protocol-buffer frames) directly in message bodies instead
        of using object storage or chunking.
      - Producers lack safeguards to check server-advertised limits at
        connection time, so later code changes silently begin sending bigger
        payloads.

    mitigation: |
      - **Enforce tighter limits**: set `max_payload` to a value ≤ 8 MB (or
         lower) in `nats-server.conf`; smaller limits force clients to chunk or
         off-load large data.
      - **Chunk or stream**: split large blobs into smaller messages that the
         consumer reassembles, or publish to JetStream Object Store / external
         storage and send only references.
      - **Add client-side guards**: validate payload size before every
         publish and reject or compress anything that would breach the limit.
      - **Monitor log & metrics**: alert on the warning string and track
         memory, pending bytes, and slow-consumer disconnect counts.
