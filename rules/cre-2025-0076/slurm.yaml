      description: >
        Detects when Slurm's accounting daemon (slurmdbd) or controller (slurmctld)
        loses connection to its MySQL database, causing job scheduling and recording
        to halt.
      impact: >
        When slurmdbd cannot reach MySQL, job accounting fails and slurmctld cannot
        schedule or record jobs. This results in a full operational blackout of the
        Slurm cluster.
      cause: >
        The MySQL server becomes unreachable (e.g., the container is stopped or crashes),
        so slurmdbd and slurmctld cannot connect. Consequently, job state updates and
        cluster accounting operations fail.
      mitigation: >
        **Immediate Actions:**
          1. Restart the MySQL container:
             ```bash
             docker start mysql
             ```
          2. Confirm MySQL is healthy:
             ```bash
             docker logs mysql --tail 20
             ```
          3. Restart Slurm services to re-establish connections:
             ```bash
             docker restart slurmdbd slurmctld
             ```
          4. Check `slurmdbd` and `slurmctld` logs for any lingering errors.
        **Long-term Fixes:**
          - Deploy MySQL on a dedicated, persistent host or highly available service.
          - Monitor MySQL health (CPU/memory/disk) and configure automatic restart.
          - Configure slurmdbd retry and timeout parameters (`DBTimeout`, `DBConnectTimeout`)
            in `slurmdbd.conf` to better tolerate transient database outages.
          - Consider a hot backup slurmdbd node or clustering MySQL.
