    title: Verbose Logging in AWS Network Policy Agent During Policy Verdicts
    category: logging-problem
    author: Prequel
    description: |
      - When using AWS Network Policy Agent with VPC CNI addon v1.17.1, the log message `failed to get caller` may appear frequently.
      - This behavior correlates with policy verdicts being evaluated, and the volume increases in environments with higher traffic or more active policies.
      - The issue does not indicate functional failure, but it increases log volume and may obscure real issues.
    cause: |
      - A logging bug in version v1.1.1 of the AWS Network Policy Agent caused excessive error messages during policy verdict processing.
      - The error message appears when the agent fails to resolve caller metadata but continues functioning normally.

    mitigation: |
      - Upgrade to AWS Network Policy Agent v1.1.2 or later, where the issue is resolved.
      - Upgrade the VPC CNI addon to v1.18.2 or later, which includes the fixed version of the agent.
      - If immediate upgrade is not possible, use log filtering or rate‑limiting in your logging pipeline to reduce noise.
