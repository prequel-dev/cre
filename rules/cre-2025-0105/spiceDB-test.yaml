      title: "SpiceDB Datastore Startup Failure"
      category: "authorization-systems"
      author: Prequel
      description: |
        Detects critical failures where a SpiceDB instance cannot start due to an invalid schema or an uninitialized datastore during the bootstrap process. This is a common configuration error that prevents the service from initializing and serving requests, leading to a total service outage.
      cause: |
        - **Invalid Schema:** The schema provided to `--datastore-bootstrap-files` contains syntactical or semantic errors, such as referencing a non-existent object type (`undefined object type user`).
        - **Uninitialized Datastore:** The datastore (e.g., Postgres) has not been properly migrated before bootstrap. SpiceDB attempts to query for existing data before its own tables (like `namespace_config`) have been created, resulting in an error like `relation "namespace_config" does not exist`. This is the specific failure you reproduced.
      impact: |
        - **Complete Authorization Service Outage:** SpiceDB will fail to start and may enter a crash loop if managed by a container orchestrator.
        - All dependent applications will lose their access control capabilities, likely resulting in widespread "permission denied" errors or full application unavailability.
        - Blocks all user authentication and authorization flows that rely on SpiceDB.
        - May prevent new user sign-ups or other critical business operations until the schema is corrected and the service is restored.

      mitigation: |
        IMMEDIATE RESPONSE:
          - Examine the SpiceDB container logs for a `FATAL` or `ERROR` level message.
          - The error is `relation "namespace_config" does not exist`:** The datastore is uninitialized. For a fresh deployment, add the `--datastore-bootstrap-overwrite` flag to the SpiceDB `serve` command to force the database migration to run before bootstrapping the schema.
          - **If the error is `undefined object type` or `schema parsing error`:** The schema itself is invalid. Retrieve the schema file, validate it using the `zed validate <file>` command, correct the errors, and redeploy.

        PREVENTIVE MEASURES:
          - Integrate `zed validate` into your CI/CD pipeline to automatically check all schema changes before deployment.
          - Use the `--datastore-bootstrap-overwrite` flag in startup commands for all initial/fresh deployments to ensure tables are created correctly.
          - Implement robust health checks that validate the service is not only running but also responsive to basic API calls after startup.
