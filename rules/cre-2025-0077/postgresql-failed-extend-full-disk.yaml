    title: PostgreSQL Fails to Extend File Due to Disk Full
    category: database-problem
    author: AndrÃ© Muta
    description: |
      PostgreSQL logs an error when it cannot extend a data file (table/index) because
      the filesystem is out of disk space. This prevents writes requiring new allocation.
    cause: |
      The disk partition hosting PostgreSQL's data directory (PGDATA) or related tablespaces is full,
      often due to data growth, table bloat, or insufficient initial disk allocation.
    impact: |
      Prevents new data writes or updates that require more disk space, leading to failed transactions.
      May escalate to a database PANIC if critical system components are affected.

    mitigation: |
      - **Verify Disk Space:** Check the disk space usage of the PostgreSQL data directory and tablespaces.
      - **Free OS-Level Space:** Delete non-PostgreSQL files (old logs, temp files) from the full partition.
      - **Free PostgreSQL Space:** If accessible, `TRUNCATE` unneeded tables, `DELETE` old data and `VACUUM`, or `DROP` unused objects. `VACUUM FULL` reclaims more space but needs some free space to run and locks tables.
      - **Expand Storage:** Increase the disk volume size at the OS or cloud provider level.
      - **Preventative Measures:** Implement disk space monitoring with alerts (e.g., >80%), schedule regular `VACUUM` operations, and perform capacity planning.
