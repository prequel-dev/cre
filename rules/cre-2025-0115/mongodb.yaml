      title: MongoDB client disconnects and socket exceptions under load
      category: mongodb-resource-exhaustion
      author: Prequel
      description: |
        - Under high client load or resource exhaustion (e.g., 1 CPU, 500MB RAM), MongoDB can begin to log a large number of socket disconnections and broken pipe errors.
        - This results in frequent connection churn, interrupted operations, and possible failed writes.
      cause: |
        - Client connections are dropped because of resource exhaustion (e.g., memory pressure or CPU starvation).
        - The MongoDB server cannot respond in time, causing broken pipes and socket disconnects.
      impact: |
        - Lost client operations.
        - Potential data integrity issues if writes are interrupted.
        - Increased latency due to reconnections.
      tags:
        - cpu-memory-exhaustion
      mitigation: |
        - Add more CPU and memory resources.
        - Introduce connection pooling and rate limiting on the client side.
        - Optimize MongoDB queries and schema to reduce pressure.
        - Monitor and alert on connection and socket exception patterns.
