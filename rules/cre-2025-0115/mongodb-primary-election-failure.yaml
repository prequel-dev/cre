      title: "MongoDB Replica Set Primary Election Failure"
      category: "mongodb-ha"
      author: Prequel
      description: |
        Detects high-severity MongoDB replica set primary election failures that result in no primary node being available,
        causing complete service unavailability. This rule targets catastrophic conditions that break replica set consensus:
          - Primary node failures followed by election timeouts where no secondary can become primary
          - Network partitions isolating replica set members and preventing quorum formation
          - Heartbeat failures and connectivity issues leading to election failures
          - Replica set state transitions indicating election problems
      cause: |
        - Primary node crashes or becomes unreachable due to hardware/network issues
        - Network partitions isolate replica set members, preventing quorum formation
        - Insufficient voting members available to elect a new primary (split-brain scenarios)
        - Election timeout settings too aggressive for network conditions
        - MongoDB configuration issues affecting election processes
        - System resource constraints (CPU, memory, disk) causing node failures
        - Firewall or security group rules blocking inter-node communication

      mitigation: |
        PREVENTION:
          - Monitor replica set member health and network connectivity
          - Set appropriate election timeout values for network conditions
          - Ensure sufficient replica set members for quorum formation
          - Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, disk) on all nodes
        RESPONSE:
          - Check replica set status: rs.status()
          - Restart failed replica set members
          - Reconnect isolated network segments
          - Force replica set reconfiguration if needed
          - Consider adding additional replica set members

        - name: mongodb
      impact: |
        - Complete write unavailability (no primary node)
        - Potential read issues depending on read preference settings
        - Application downtime and service disruption
        - Risk of data inconsistency in split-brain scenarios
