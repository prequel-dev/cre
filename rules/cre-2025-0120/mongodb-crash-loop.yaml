      title: MongoDB Crash Loop Due to WiredTiger Metadata Corruption
      category: mongodb-startup-failure
      author: Community
      description: |
        Detects MongoDB failures where the server enters a crash loop due to corrupted WiredTiger metadata.
        This prevents startup and often requires manual repair or restoration from backups.
      cause: |
        WiredTiger metadata corruption caused by unclean shutdowns, disk failures, or filesystem issues. 
        MongoDB is unable to initialize its storage engine due to invalid or unreadable metadata.
      impact: |
        Database remains unavailable due to repeated startup failures. 
        Services relying on MongoDB experience outages and potential data loss.
        Errors referencing WiredTiger metadata corruption are observed in the logs.

      mitigation: |
        Prevent unclean shutdowns, monitor disk and filesystem health, run regular backups.
        If corruption occurs, attempt recovery with mongod --repair, or restore from a known good backup.
