      title: Envoy Proxy Crash Due to Assertion Failure
      category: envoy-proxy-failures
      author: Prequel
      description: |
        Detects Envoy proxy crashes caused by assertion failures during startup or runtime.
        Assertion crashes typically include "critical][assert]" and "critical][backtrace]" entries followed by process termination.
      cause: |
        Envoy aborts due to violated internal invariants, misconfigured listeners, invalid filter state,
        or other unexpected runtime conditions.
      impact: |
        Envoy process crashes and traffic is disrupted. Assertion failures often indicate urgent, real-time production issues.

      mitigation: |
        Validate with `envoy --mode validate -c config.yaml`, confirm resource definitions,
        use stable Envoy versions, monitor crash loops.
