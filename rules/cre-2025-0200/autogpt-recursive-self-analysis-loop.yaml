    title: AutoGPT Recursive Self-Analysis Loop Leading to Token Exhaustion and System Crash
    category: infinite-loop-problem
    author: prequel
    description: |
      - AutoGPT enters an infinite recursive loop when attempting to analyze and fix its own execution errors
      - The agent repeatedly tries to debug its own code, spawning new analysis tasks for each failure
      - Each iteration consumes API tokens and memory, eventually exhausting resources
      - The loop accelerates as error messages grow longer, consuming tokens exponentially
      - System becomes unresponsive and crashes with out-of-memory errors or API rate limit failures
    cause: |
      - AutoGPT's autonomous reasoning incorrectly identifies its own execution as a problem to solve
      - Lack of loop detection mechanisms allows unlimited recursive task spawning
      - Error context accumulation causes exponential growth in prompt size
      - Missing safeguards for self-referential task creation
      - Insufficient resource monitoring and circuit breakers for runaway processes

    mitigation: |
      - Implement loop detection to identify and break recursive self-analysis patterns
      - Add resource consumption thresholds (tokens, memory, API calls) with automatic shutdown
      - Create task depth limits to prevent unlimited recursion
      - Implement circuit breakers that trigger after repeated similar failures
      - Add explicit blacklist for self-referential task creation
      - Monitor token usage rate and implement exponential backoff
      - Use separate monitoring process to detect and kill runaway AutoGPT instances
      - Implement task deduplication to prevent identical recursive operations
